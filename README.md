📌 Project Overview

Tradition is a vital component of identity, providing insight into shared communal values. This project investigates the "dual space" occupied by diaspora communities, who must balance host culture adaptation with the preservation of inherited traditions in fragmented or altered contexts.

🔬 Research Questions

    How are traditional art forms being preserved, adapted, or transformed within diaspora communities? 

How do intergenerational dynamics influence the transmission and adaptation of these art forms?

🔑 Key Findings & Theoretical Frameworks

    Intergenerational Environmental Stability: Populations with ancestors from stable environments tend to maintain traditions more persistently, whereas those from unstable backgrounds are more receptive to change.

The "Double Bind of Inheritance": Migrants often face a conflict between passing on traditional practices and the pressure of social/economic assimilation.

Cultural Authenticity: Cultural symbols (e.g., "curry") can become sites of both authentic expression and stereotyping, requiring constant negotiation and reinterpretation.

Transnational Social Fields: Migrants occupy spaces where they maintain simultaneous connections to both their homelands and host societies.

🛠️ Methodology

    Design: Qualitative study using thematic analysis.

Population: 10–15 participants from diverse backgrounds (South Asian, Pacific, Latin American).

Data Collection: Interviews with artists, community elders, and cultural organizers, alongside observations at multicultural events.

🎯 Expected Outcomes

    Living Archives: Traditional arts will be showcased as adaptive and resilient rather than static.

Hybrid Expressions: Younger generations are expected to blend traditional forms with influences from their host cultures.

Policy Impact: The research aims to inform cultural sustainability initiatives and support systems for youth-led innovations in the arts.
